        <p style="margin: 25px 0 0 10%; width: 80%; line-height: 30px;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">
        The history of our culture begins with the idea of unification and cultural diversity.
        The founders of Alpha Culture wanted anyone from anywhere to be able to share ideas without barriers and obstacles in the way to prevent it.
        With this idea in mind, the possibilities of cultural convergence and diffusion increased as there was nothing in between to prevent it.
        This was no easy task but it wasn't impossible either. The founders thought to themselves: What can we take here, bring
        to anywhere, and still convey a comprehensible idea?
        After extensive debate and thinking, the founders came to the conclusion of math, but what makes math so universal: NUMBERS.
        The founders wanted the culture to represent freedom and independence all while offering the ability to be a part of a diverse
        group of people.
        This group of people would be able to converse and share ideas without having to worry about prejudice or discrimination. Everyone has the equal opportunity to be and live.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <strong style="font-size: 20px;">And that is when Alpha Culture came to be.</strong>
        </p>

        <strong>Greeting:</strong>
        Informal greetings range from a simple handshake to a wave, however placing your fist on your heart symbolizes how strong you feel about a person. This is generally done when 
        greeting family members, those you respect, or those you love.

        <strong>Physical Geography:</strong>
        Alpha Culture is not about physical boundaries but instead about the people itself. Alpha Culture doesn't a specific area
        where all citizens reside, however Alphanians generally
        tend to be close to developed cities with an average standard of living. This is mainly due to the fact that Alpha Culture is economically and scientifically focused on technology.
