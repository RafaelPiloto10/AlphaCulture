        <h2 style="text-align: center;">History of Alpha Culture</h2>
        <p style="margin: 25px 0 0 10%; width: 80%;text-indent: 40px; line-height: 30px;font-size: 20px;">The history of our culture begins with the idea of unionification and cultural diversity.
        The founders of Alpha Culture wanted anyone from anywhere to be able to share ideas without barriers and obstacles in the way to prevent it.
        With this idea in mind, the possibilites of cultural convergence and diffusion increased as there was nothing in between to prevent it.
        This was no easy task but it wasn't impossible either. The founders thought to themselves: What can we take here, bring to anywhere, and still convey a comprehesiable idea?
        After extensive debate and thinking, the founders came to the conclusion of math, but what makes math so universal: NUMBERS.
        The founders wanted the culture to represent freedom and independece all while offering the ability to be a part of a diverse group of people.
        This group of people would be able to converse and share ideas without having to worry about prejudice or discrimination. Everyone has the equal opportunity to be and live.
        <strong>Greeting:</strong>
        Informal greetings range from a simple handshake to a wave, however placing your fist on your heart symbolizes how strong you feel about a person. This is generally done when 
        greeeting family members, those you respect, or those you love. 
        <strong>Attire:</strong>
        Casual attire is worn all throughout the world. This can be a T-Shirt with jeans or shorts, however on important events an Alphanian is expected to be dressed in Formal attire such as 
        a suit. It is considered to be humble and respectful when an Alphanian wears sandals.

        <strong>Physical Geography:</strong>
        Alpha Culture is not about phyisical boundaries but instead about the people itself. Alpha Culture doesn't a specific area where all citizens resided, however Alphanians generally
        tend to be close to developed cities with an average standard of living. This is mainly due to the fact that Alpha Culture is economically and scientifically focused on technology. 

        <strong>Gender Roles:</strong>
        Alpha Culture represents freedom and unity. There are no gender roles in Alpha Culture.

        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong style="font-size: 22px;">And that is when Alpha Culture came to be.</strong></p>
